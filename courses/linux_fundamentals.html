    <section >Many events led up to creating the first Linux kernel and, 
        ultimately, the Linux operating system (OS), starting with the Unix operating system's release by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (whom both worked for AT&T at the time) in 1970. The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was released in 1977, but since it contained the Unix code owned by AT&T, a resulting lawsuit limited the development of BSD. Richard Stallman started the GNU project in 1983. His goal was to create a free Unix-like operating system, and part of his work resulted in the GNU General Public License (GPL) being created. Projects by others over the years failed to result in a working, free kernel that would become widely adopted until the creation of the Linux kernel.</section>

        <section >
           <br> At first, Linux was a personal project started in 1991 by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds. His goal was to create a new, free operating system kernel. Over the years, the Linux kernel has gone from a small number of files written in C under licensing that prohibited commercial distribution to the latest version with over 23 million source code lines (comments excluded), licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.

        <section>
            Linux is available in over 600 distributions (or an operating system based on the Linux kernel and supporting software and libraries). Some of the most popular and well-known being Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, elementary, Manjaro, Gentoo Linux, RedHat, and Linux Mint.
            <br>
            Linux is generally considered more secure than other operating systems, and while it has had many kernel vulnerabilities in the past, it is becoming less and less frequent. It is less susceptible to malware than Windows operating systems and is very frequently updated. Linux is also very stable and generally affords very high performance to the end-user. However, it can be more difficult for beginners and does not have as many hardware drivers as Windows.
            <br>   
            Since Linux is free and open-source, the source code can be modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone. Linux-based operating systems run on servers, mainframes, desktops, embedded systems such as routers, televisions, video game consoles, and more. The overall Android operating system that runs on smartphones and tablets is based on the Linux kernel, and because of this, Linux is the most widely installed operating system.
            <br>   
            Linux is an operating system like Windows, iOS, Android, or macOS. An OS is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with our computer. That means that an OS manages the whole communication between software and hardware. Also, there exist many different distributions (distro). It is like a version of Windows operating systems.
            <br>
            With the interactive instances, we get access to the Pwnbox, a customized version of Parrot OS. This will be the primary OS we will work with through the modules. Parrot OS is a Debian-based Linux distribution that focuses on security, privacy, and development.

<h3 style="color:#f5eeee;font-weight:bold;font-family:Calibri;font-size:20">Linux follows five core principles:

</h3> 
<article style="color:#f5eeee;font-weight:bold;font-family:Calibri;font-size:20">
    Principle	Description
<li>Everything is a file	All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux operating system are stored in one or more text files.
</li> 
   <li>Small, single-purpose programs	Linux offers many different tools that we will work with, which can be combined to work together.
</li> 
 <li>   Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks	The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large and complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results.
</li>
   <li> Avoid captive user interfaces	Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over the operating system.
</li>
   <li> Configuration data stored in a text file	An example of such a file is the /etc/passwd file, which stores all users registered on the system.
